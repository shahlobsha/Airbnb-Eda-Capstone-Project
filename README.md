**Airbnb** is a prominent online hospitality marketplace connecting travelers with lodging options worldwide. Founded in 2008, it has revolutionized travel by enabling individuals to rent a variety of accommodations directly from hosts. This sharing economy platform offers unique stays, ranging from cozy homes to unconventional spaces. Airbnb has created a global community of hosts and travelers, providing diverse and cost-effective lodging choices. While it's transformed the way people travel, Airbnb has also faced regulatory challenges, housing concerns, and community impacts in some regions due to its disruptive influence on traditional hospitality and housing markets.


The project focuses on conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnb data from New York City in 2019. This analysis aims to gain insights into the Airbnb market in NYC, explore patterns and trends, and provide valuable information for hosts, travelers, and potential investors.

Key Objectives:


1. **Understand Market Dynamics:** The project intends to comprehend the dynamics of the Airbnb market in NYC. This includes identifying peak booking seasons, pricing trends, and the types of properties available for rental.

2. **Geospatial Analysis**: Utilizing geospatial data, the analysis will explore the distribution of listings across different neighborhoods in NYC. This will help uncover which areas are most popular among Airbnb users.

3. **Pricing Strategies:** The study will delve into how hosts price their listings. It will analyze factors such as property type, neighborhood, and the impact of different amenities on pricing.

4. **Property Types:** By categorizing and analyzing various property types (e.g., apartments, houses, private rooms), the analysis will provide insights into the most common types of listings and their respective demand.


The analysis was conducted to gain insights into the factors influencing Airbnb prices in New York City and to discover patterns among all variables. This endeavor aimed to provide valuable information for both travelers and hosts in the city while offering insights for the Airbnb business.

The project involved the meticulous exploration and cleaning of the dataset to ensure its readiness for analysis. This encompassed a deep dive into understanding the dataset's characteristics, including data types, identification of missing values, and the distribution of data. The cleaning process was equally rigorous, addressing issues such as data errors, missing values and duplicate entries.

After the dataset's meticulous preparation, we proceeded to explore and summarize it by describing the data, creating data visualizations, and identifying underlying patterns and trends.

Data visualization was a fundamental tool in uncovering and understanding Airbnb data patterns. We harnessed graphs and charts to visually represent the dataset and appended valuable insights and observations under each visualization. This approach facilitated a deeper comprehension of the data and allowed for the identification of pertinent insights and patterns that might have remained concealed within the raw data.
